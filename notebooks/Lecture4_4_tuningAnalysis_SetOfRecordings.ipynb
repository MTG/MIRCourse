    "### Tuning analysis for a set of recordings from the same mode\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was written for the tutorial offered at the 19th ISMIR Conference in Paris, France, on September 23rd, 2018 titled [\"Computational Approaches for Analysis of Non-Western Music Traditions\"](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/non-western-music-tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate tuning analysis of a set of recordings in several modes. The names of the modes and number of files used in each mode is set in the second code cell. \n",
    "The following steps are carried:\n",
    "- A group of recordings from the set of files listed in the [annotations.json file](https://github.com/MTG/otmm_makam_recognition_dataset ) in the given modes are downloaded as the first step.\n",
    "- Then pitch analysis and pitch distribution computation is carried\n",
    "- Tonic annotation is accessed from Dunya and interval distributions are computed (with respect to tonic)\n",
    "- Octave folding is applied and mean of all distributions are computed\n",
    "- Automatic peak picking applied to detect scale degrees' distance to the tonic\n",
    "- Interval list stored in the Scala format (http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/) to be able to sonify the intervals using computer keyboard. A Scala file(.scl) is created for each mode in the modes list. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to download sounds from Dunya, you would need to create a user and obtain an API authenticaion key(token). Please create your user from: https://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/developers/ In order to get your API token you have to log in to Dunya, access your profile, you will find your token there. "
